//Task 1: Write a simple software that asks for userâ€™s age then calculates the zoo ticket cost based on
//the given age: if age < 5 then ticket is free, if age is between 5 and 10 then ticket costs $10, if age is
//between 11 and 16 then ticket costs $20, if age is greater than 16 then ticket costs $25. Display the
//ticket price information for the user to see
